Solarized Dark Theme
====================

Customized default theme to match Solarized Dark default color scheme. Nothing fancy, just making the colors match.

- Clone into `Packages/Theme - Solarized Dark`
- Add `"theme": "Solarized Dark.sublime-theme"` to your user preferences

I use [Source Code Pro Light](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sourcecodepro.adobe/) as my main font, so you'll have to change that probably.
